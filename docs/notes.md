## refactor library page layout:
- add a reset input function to the search input
- add "text" as option to the filters
- add posibility to handle hundreds of documents
- add "update document from source" function to documents pointing to external links




## features
- add a button "do websearch" to the entity sidebar. this function should create a search query, execute it and return some document previews from links that can be added to the library

- the tag filter should react to mouse clicks too - currently it only reacts to keyboard input
