# notes

- it seems that the streaming of the chat response is not working anymore. check the docs to make sure we are using the correct API for straming 


## features


- improve starter prompt suggestions for chat-about -doc/entity 
- make sure data retrieval from local sources for chat context follows best practices (function calling?)

- link mentioned documents (e.g.  KB: “OpenAI”) and entities in the chat response to the local docs and entities 

highlight connections between entities in graph module on hover
